    <p>Mr. Barangay Captain</p> 
    <p>{{$brgy}}</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sir,</p> <br>
    <p>
        I am Mr./Mrs. {{$compName}} a Filipino, and I am writing this letter to report a disturbance over my property located at {{$compAddress}}. 
        Attached to this letter is a copy of the property title clearly showing that I am the registered owner of the above property.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        There are illegal occupants currently found in my land. On I and my partners went to the property to ask them to vacate, however, they refused to heed our request. 
        Again, on my partner went to my property and politely asked them to leave the premises of our property as we will now be using it. It was during this visit that things 
        somehow got heated and so my partner decided to leave before things get out of hand. Still, they refused to leave.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        That is why I am constrained to write to you this letter, as the Punong Barangay of the community. The names of these persons illegally occupying my property are:
    </p>

    <p>1. __________</p>
    <p>2. __________</p>
    <p>3. __________</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        May I respectfully ask your legal and logistical assistance in resolving this matter. Please contact me at {{$conNum}} for the schedule of hearing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Respectfully,</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mr. {{$compName}}</p>
